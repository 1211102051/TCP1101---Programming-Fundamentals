# Write a Program

Write a program that accepts two positive integers $N$ (the number of mountains) and $H$ (the height of the mountain). The program then outputs $N$ continuous mountains of height $H$.

## Input Range

*The input to this program will only come from the following range. (Your code does not need to check if the input is in this range).*

- $1 \leq N \leq 15$
- $1 \leq H \leq 9$

## Sample Run 1

```
N -> 2
H -> 5
