# Fill in the Missing Code

You are given a program that accepts a positive integer $N$ indicating $N$ test cases.

For each test case, the program accepts a word $W$ in one line, followed by two positive integers $A$ and $B$ ($A \leq B$). It then outputs the substring of $W$ from index $A$ to index $B$ inclusive.

For example, if $W$ is ```threeblindmice```, $A$ is 5 and $B$ is 9, then the output is ```blind```.

Unfortunately, the program is incomplete due to missing code in the ```PrintSubstring()``` function.

Fill in the missing code in the ```PrintSubstring()``` function so that the program works as intended.

## WARNING

This question is designed to test your knowledge on Pointers. If you use other approaches that do not demonstrate your skills in Pointers, or write anything outside the ```PrintSubstring()``` function, you will get zero even if your output is correct.

## Input Range

*The input to this program will only come from the following range. (Your code does not need to check if the input is in this range).*

- $1 \leq N \leq 10$
- $1 \leq A, B \leq 1000000$
