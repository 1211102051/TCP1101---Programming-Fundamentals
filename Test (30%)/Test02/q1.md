# Write a Program

Write a program that accepts a positive integer $N$ indicating $N$ test cases.

For each test case, the program accepts two positive integers $M$ and $D$ in one line, and outputs the integer divisible by $D$ that is nearest to $M$.

For example, the nearest integer to $122$ that is divisible by $5$ is $120$. 

If there are two equally nearest integers, the program outputs the smallest among them.

## Input Range

*The input to this program will only come from the following range. (Your code does not need to check if the input is in this range).*

- $1 \leq N \leq 10$
- $1 \leq M \leq 1000000$
- $1 \leq D < M$

## Sample Run 1

```
N -> 4

Input:
122 5
Output:
120

Input:
999 131
Output:
1048

Input:
21 6
Output:
18

Input:
24  6
Output:
24
```

## Sample Run 2

```
N -> 2

Input:
1 1
Output:
1

Input:
99 1
Output:
99
