# Fill in the Missing Code

In Malaysia, "Teh Tarik" (or 'pulled tea') is a popular hot milk tea whose name is derived from the pouring process of "pulling" the drink during preparation.

This program intends to simulate the pouring process. It creates several tea jugs with different capacity and amount. Then, it pours the tea from one jug to another for several times. After each pour, the program outputs the amount of tea in each jug.

The program has a ```Jug``` class with missing code in the ```pourTo()``` method. Suppose there are two jug objects ```jugA``` and ```jugB```. The code ```jugA.pourTo(jugB)``` should pour all amount of tea from ```jugA``` to ```jugB```, or pour until ```jugB``` is full (i.e. its amount is equal to its capacity). There is no effect on both jugs when ```jugA``` is empty, or when ```jugB``` is full.

Fill in the missing code in the ```pourTo()``` method so that the program runs as intended.

## WARNING

This question is designed to test your knowledge on Classes and Objects. If you solve the question by editing the code outside the ```pourTo()``` method, you will get zero even if your output is correct.
