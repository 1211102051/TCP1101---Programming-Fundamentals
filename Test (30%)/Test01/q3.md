# Write a Program

Write a program that accepts a positive integer $N$ indicating $N$ test cases.

For each test case, the program accepts a word $W$ that consists only of small alphabets, and outputs the number of unique consonants in the word.

A consonant is a non-vowel alphabet.

## Input Range

*The input to this program will only come from the following range. (Your code does not need to check if the input is in this range).*

- $1 \leq N \leq 10$
- $1 \leq W.length() \leq 100$
- $W$ contains small alphabets only.
