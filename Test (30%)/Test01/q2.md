# Write a Program

Write a program that accepts a positive integer $N$ indicating $N$ test cases.

For each test case, the program accepts two positive integers $A_0$ and $L$, and sums a sequence of terms as follows:

$A_0 + A_1 + A_2 + ... + A_K$

where
- $A_{i+1} = A_i + i $
- $A_K$ is the largest term less than or equal to $L$.

For example, when $A_0 = 3$ and $L = 15$,
- $A_1 = A_0 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4$
- $A_2 = A_1 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6$
- $A_3 = A_2 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9$
- $A_4 = A_3 + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13$
- $A_5 = A_4 + 5 = 13 + 5 = 18$

Since $A_4$ is the largest term less than or equal to $L$, the sum is calculated up to $A_4$, not $A_5$.

$3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 13 = 35$

## Input Range

*The input to this program will only come from the following range. (Your code does not need to check if the input is in this range).*

- $1 \leq N \leq 10$
- $1 \leq A_0 \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq L \leq 5000$
