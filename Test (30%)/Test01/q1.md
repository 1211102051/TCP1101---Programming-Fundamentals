# Write a Program

Write a program that accepts a positive integer $N$ indicating $N$ test cases.

For each test case, the program accepts two positive integers $A$ and $B$. It then outputs EQUAL if both integers are equal. Otherwise, the program not only shows NOT EQUAL, but also checks the signs of both integers. If both integers have the same sign, the program shows SAME SIGN. Otherwise, the program shows DIFFERENT SIGN.

## Input Range

*The input to this program will only come from the following range. (Your code does not need to check if the input is in this range).*

- $1 \leq N \leq 10$
- $1 \leq A, B \leq 1000000$

## Sample Run 1

```
N -> 4

Input:
-123 -123
Output:
EQUAL

Input:
19 91
Output:
NOT EQUAL
SAME SIGN

Input:
19 -91
Output:
NOT EQUAL
DIFFERENT SIGN

Input:
-99 -11
Output:
NOT EQUAL
SAME SIGN
```
